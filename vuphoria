     * web site at https://developer.vuforia.com/license-manager.
     *
     * Vuforia license keys are always 380 characters long, and look as if they contain mostly
     * random data. As an example, here is a example of a fragment of a valid key:

     * and paste it in to your code on the next line, between the double quotes.
